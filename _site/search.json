My overall goal is to reduce addictive-like behavior in populations with higher risk."

I physically conducted this research starting in June 2022 and finished data collection in December 2022. Over this period we did a plethora of tests including rotarod, open-field, elevated plus maze, 3 chamber social, y-maze, marble burying, but my main task interests were measures of learning (lever-press learning), impulsive choice (delay discounting), and impulsive action (DRL schedule).\n\nPeer-Reviewed Conference Presentations\nThieret, B.

This project was the first project I worked on in the lab helping a senior in the Spring of 2022, but continued as the lead researcher on the project over the Summer of 2022. During the Spring a temporal bisection task and delay discounting task were done and over the Summer a progressive ratio schedule was tested along with a short-term memory task.\n\nPeer-Reviewed Conference Presentations\nThieret, B.
