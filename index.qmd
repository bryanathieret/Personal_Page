## About

I am a senior at St. Lawrence University majoring in Psychology and Statistics and expected to graduate May 2024. I will be going into a PhD program for Psychology where I will continue to explore the interaction of early-life stress and addiction-like behavior (e.g., gambling, nicotine use, alcohol use disorder, substance use disorder, etc.,). My overall goal is to reduce addictive-like behavior in populations with higher risk.

## Main Projects
### Impulsivity in Early-Life Stress Paradigms  

This is a project I am doing independently as my senior year project and am combining both my psychology and statistics perspectives together to do a meta-analysis along side with simulations evaluating differences in impulsivity in different early-life stress paradigms (e.g., limited bedding and nesting paradigm, maternal separation, maternal deprivation, etc.,). There are many inconsistencies within the literature for all early-life stress paradigms which has led me to trying to find the discrepancies within paradigms in addition to across paradigms.  


### The Effect of Extra Enrichment on Behavior in the Limited Bedding and Nesting Paradigm  

The year after completing my first limited bedding and nesting (LBN) paradigm, I did another LBN paradigm with the deviation this time of how enrichment type (normal enrichment vs. extra enrichment) impacts behavior. This project began in Spring 2023 and continued over the Summer and ended in December 2023. We did many tasks over this large period of time which included lever-press learning (rate of learning), delay discounting, temporal bisection task, and dissociation of low rates of responding schedule.

### Precrastination Behavior in Humans and Non-Humans  
In Dr. Fox's independent lab we have explored precrastination behavior defined as doing something sooner and at some additional cost with both animals and humans. Starting in August 2022 I helped on a senior's research project where they were replicating the bucket study by Rosenbaum et al. (2014) with intro psychology students to determine the validity of precrastination behavior. In January 2023 as a TA I trained a pair of rats carrying a marble into a "goal" hole at the end (i.e., the animal version of the bucket study).

### Limited Bedding and Nesting Paradigm: A model for chronic early-life stress

The Limited Bedding and Nesting (LBN) Paradigm is a model for chronic early-life stress where reducing the amount of material for the dam to nest with results in increased levels of fragmentation (i.e., early-life stress) and is done between postnatal day 2-9. I physically conducted this research starting in June 2022 and finished data collection in December 2022. Over this period we did a plethora of tests including rotarod, open-field, elevated plus maze, 3 chamber social, y-maze, marble burying, but my main task interests were measures of learning (lever-press learning), impulsive choice (delay discounting), and impulsive action (DRL schedule).

### FMR1 KO Rat Model  

The FMR1 KO rat is a genetically modified animal model for Fragile X Syndrome which is a commodity for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) (Males = 50-75%, Females = 25%). This project was the first project I worked on in the lab helping a senior in the Spring of 2022, but continued as the lead researcher on the project over the Summer of 2022. During the Spring a temporal bisection task and delay discounting task were done and over the Summer a progressive ratio schedule was tested along with a short-term memory task.
